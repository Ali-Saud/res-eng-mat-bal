4. Implement forecast model for single or multiple wells
5. contribute with user cases and examples from public data
6. Contribute to testing, unit testing 
7. Contribute to documentation

## Kind of contributions we are NOT looking for

## Getting started

If you want to contribute to a project and make it better, your help is very welcome.
Look for a project's contribution instructions. If there are any, follow them.

* Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
* Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called origin.
* Add the original repository as a remote called upstream.
* If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
* Create a new branch to work on!
* Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
* Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
* Write or adapt tests as needed.
* Add or change the documentation as needed.
* Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote origin.

Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from upstream to your local repo and delete your extra branch(es).

## How to report a bug

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. **Email us instead.**

Any security issues should be submitted directly to alejandro.primera@gmail.com. In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions.

* What version of Python are you using (Python version)?
* What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
* What did you do?
* What did you expect to see?
* What did you see instead?
